# Two applications for estimating Pi using MIXMAX random number generator and Monte Carlo method

We review some pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) based on the theory of mixing in
classical mechanical systems. In particular, we explore in detail the statistical characteristics of MIXMAX
pseudo-random number generator such as its entropy, period and spectrum. We then apply this generator
along with Monte Carlo method to estimate the value of Pi in two different ways, using the relation between
approximated areas. We compare these results with those obtained using MATLABâ€™s default PRNG. The
results of these simulations show the effectiveness, precision, consistency and viability of the random numbers
generated by MIXMAX.
